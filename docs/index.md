# The Blueprint of Questions

> This page is unfinished.
> But then, so is the question it poses.

---

## What is this?

A blueprint?
A question?
A blueprint *of* questions?

Yes.

---

It is a pattern,
for arranging thoughts
that do not yet exist.

It is a structure,
you can walk through
without knowing where it ends.

---

## Who built this?

A question did.

Or maybe a questioner.
Or maybe someone pretending to be both.

---

## Whatâ€™s the purpose?

To inquire.
To reflect.
To loop.

---

## How to read it?

Start anywhere.
Ask why.
See what happens.
